  Andrew Yan-Tak Ng (Chinese: 吳恩達; born 1976) is a Chinese American computer scientist. He is the former chief scientist at Baidu, where he led the company's Artificial Intelligence Group. He is an adjunct professor (formerly associate professor) at Stanford University. Ng is also the co-founder and chairman of Coursera, an online education platform.[2]

  Andrew was a professor at Stanford University Department of Computer Science and Department of Electrical Engineering. He became Director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab where he taught students and undertook research related to data mining and machine learning. From 2011 to 2012, he worked at Google, where he founded and led the Google Brain Deep Learning Project. In 2012, he co-founded Coursera to offer free online courses for everyone after over 100,000 students registered for Ng's popular course.[4] Today, several million people have taken the online course. In 2014, he joined[5] Baidu as Chief Scientist, and carried out research related to big data and A.I. In March 2017, he announced his resignation from Baidu.[6]

He soon afterwards launched Deeplearning.ai,[7] an online curriculum of classes. Then Ng launched Landing.ai[8], bringing AI to manufacturing factories, announcing a partnership with FoxConn.[9]

In 2018, Ng unveiled the AI Fund,[10] raising $175 million to invest in new startups. He is also the chairman of Woebot and on the board of drive.ai.[11][12]


Ng researches primarily in machine learning and deep learning. His early work includes the Stanford Autonomous Helicopter project, which developed one of the most capable autonomous helicopters in the world,[13][14] and the STAIR (STanford Artificial Intelligence Robot) project,[15] which resulted in ROS, a widely used open-source robotics software platform.

In 2011, Ng founded the Google Brain project at Google, which developed very large scale artificial neural networks using Google's distributed computer infrastructure.[16] Among its notable results was a neural network trained using deep learning algorithms on 16,000 CPU cores, that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, after watching only YouTube videos, and without ever having been told what a "cat" is.[17][18] The project's technology is currently also used in the Android Operating System's speech recognition system.[19]

He together with David M. Blei and Michael I. Jordan, coauthored the influential paper that introduced Latent Dirichlet allocation.[20]
